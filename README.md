## 👤 About Me

I am a **final-year B.Tech Computer Science student (2026)** with a strong foundation in **software engineering principles, system design, and problem-solving**.  
My work reflects a practical understanding of how modern software systems are **designed, deployed, tested, and operated** in cloud environments.

I focus on:
- Writing **clear, maintainable code**
- Designing **scalable and fault-tolerant systems**
- Applying **automation and infrastructure-as-code**
- Understanding systems **end-to-end**, from development to deployment

## 🧠 Engineering Focus

Across all projects, I consistently prioritize:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Infrastructure automation over manual configuration
- Observability and reliability as first-class concerns
- Practical trade-off analysis rather than over-engineering

These projects are designed to reflect **how systems are built in professional engineering teams**, not just how they work in isolation.
