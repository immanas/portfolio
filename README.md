# 🚀 Manas Gantait — Software, Cloud & DevOps Engineering Portfolio

This repository represents my work across **software engineering, cloud architecture, DevOps automation, and full-stack development** ☁️🌐.  
It focuses on building **reliable backend systems**, **automated cloud infrastructure**, and **end-to-end applications**, following real-world engineering practices rather than theoretical examples.

## 👤 About Me

I am a **final-year B.Tech Computer Science student (2026)** with hands-on experience spanning **Java backend development**, **cloud-native system design**, **DevOps automation**, and **full-stack application workflows** 💻🔧.  
My work reflects how production systems are **designed, deployed, monitored, and evolved** across cloud environments.  

I actively work as:
- ☕ **Java Developer** — backend services, APIs, and system logic
- 🌐 **Full-Stack Developer** — integrating backend systems with usable frontends
- ☁️ **Cloud Engineer / Cloud Architect (Entry-Level)** — designing and deploying scalable cloud resources
- 🔁 **DevOps Engineer** — automating builds, deployments, and infrastructure workflows

## 🧩 What This Portfolio Shows 

This repository includes:
- 📸 **Screenshots of frontend interfaces** (UI, dashboards, user flows)
- 🧠 **Backend and API execution views** (request handling, logic flow)
- ☁️ **Cloud and DevOps workflows** (infrastructure setup, automation pipelines)
- 🌐 **Portfolio visuals** demonstrating application integration and system behavior

Each artifact is meant to show **how systems work together**, not just isolated features.

## 🧠 Engineering Approach 

Across my work, I consistently prioritize:
- 🧱 Clear separation of concerns
- 🤖 Automation over manual processes
- 🔍 Observability and reliability as first-class concerns
- ⚖️ Practical trade-off analysis instead of over-engineering

The goal is always to build systems that are **understandable, operable, and dependable**.
